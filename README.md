# mqPC

Please note that the .exe is the version that does not contain UI changes (fully functional)

The code will build a version with very minimal / work in progress UI editing.
You will need to include PAHO yourself (for now) until I figure out the licensing.

There are edits made to the PAHO code in the binary - these are changes that SHOULD be made to the actual PAHO code that others have made requests for but the code is essentially abandoned by the maintainers at this point, sadly.
